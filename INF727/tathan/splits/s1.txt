## Building Spark

Spark is built using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).
To build Spark and its example programs, run:

    build/mvn -DskipTests clean package

(You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.)
More detailed documentation is available from the project site, at
["Building Spark"](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html).

## Interactive Scala Shell

The easiest way to start using Spark is through the Scala shell:

    ./bin/spark-shell

Try the following command, which should return 1000:

    scala> sc.parallelize(1 to 1000).count()
